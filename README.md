<h2 align=center> SOLAR POWER PREDICTION USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN AWS </h2>

Solar power is a free and clean alternative to traditional fossil fuels.

However, nowadays, solar cells' efficiency is not as high as we would like, so selecting the ideal conditions for its installation is critical in obtaining the maximum amount of energy out of it.

We want to predict the power output for a particular array of solar power generators, knowing some environmental conditions.

Solar power forecasting is  very usefull in smooth operation and control of solar power plant. Generation of energy by a solar panel or cell depends upon the doping level  and design of solar PV array but  the main factors are the amount of solar radiation falling on the panel, environmental factors like atmospheric temperature and humidity  and  dust present on the panels .  These factors are naturally variable  and hence the output of solar cell  directly depend on it. Also, the solar irradiance as well as all the above-mentioned factors are variable throughout the day. Hourly average or average at a particular interval of time of these parameters received is measured for better prediction of output of a PV module and thus a solar power plant. The lower  the  sampling rate better will be the predication.

This Project is based on the solar power output prediction using artificial
intelligence.Due to limited resources, more focus on pollution free and natural
resources made us to focus on methods to improve the output of solar.Records of 7
consecutive days is taken as input data and trained by the algorithms in machine
learning.Algorithms like linear, ridge, lasso, decision tree, random forest and artificial
neural networks have been implemented.Amazon web Service EC-2 Instance cloud,an Linux
Virtual OS Environment run on Amazon web service is used.Data is taken for every half an
hour interval in Solcast API. And the latitude and longitude is obtained from accuweather Api,
To supply to  Solcast Api. The total output generated at the end of the day is calculated earlier and an
Email is autogenerated using the Simple Mail Service[SES] of Amazon and send to the
Clients.The output of the solar is predicted with the changes of the weather also.It has
been observed that improved accuracy is achieved through random forest and ridge
regressor.Its very helpful to the Solarpower sations and house in many other fields.

**About DATA**
* temperature, daily average temperature, in degrees Celsius.
* wind-direction, daily average wind direction, in degrees (0-360).
* wind-speed, daily average wind speed, in meters per second.
* visibility, in kilometers.
* humidity, in percentage.
* average-wind-speed-(period), average wind speed during the 3-hour period de measure was taken in, in meters per second.
* average-pressure-(period), average barometric pressure during the 3-hour period de measure was taken in, in mercury inches.
* power-generated, in KW for each 30-minute period.

Dependencies
---------
* Python 3.8
* Pandas 
* Tensorflow 2.2
* Keras
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy

**About DATA**
* First create an API in accuweather to obtain latitude and longitude, 
* sign-up in Solcast Api to obtain weather data for your location.
* create a AWS(Amazon Web service) account, then create an ec2 linux instance , save the key file.
* Download Filezilla and upload this code in it, with the folder name 'solar'.
* create a AWS SES (simple email service), verify your Email to send mail.
* Download Putty. then run code in using the linux comment (cd python3 "Full file path"/main.py)

As a result Solar output is send from your mail to the required user.
